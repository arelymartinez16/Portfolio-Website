    <!-- <p>Hey, my name is Arely Martinez Garcia! I recently graduated from high school, and I'm currently attending Lehman College. I intend to major in Computer Science, and I want to pursue a bachelor's degree. I am currently learning Python, HTMl, CSS, and Javascript. I am so eager to take my skills to the next level! I want to help underrepresented communities in many ways. At the moment, I want to spread awareness about issues that occur around the world by making activist websites. Eventually, I would like to contribute to new technologies that would help the disabled or develop something that represents different communities. My coding projects can be found on the portfolio page.</p> -->
    <p>Hey, my name is Arely Martinez Garcia! I am a senior and currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in
      Computer Science at Lehman College. I have experience with Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript, and I am actively
      working to improve my skills in these areas. As a student at Lehman College, I am currently learning Java. I am
      actively working to develop my skills and knowledge in this programming language, and I am eager to apply what I
      have learned in real-world projects and contribute to the tech industry. My goal is to use my knowledge and skills
      in computer science to support and empower underrepresented communities through the development of innovative
      technologies and solutions. Coding has always been a passion of mine, and I am excited to be able to use my skills
      to make a positive impact in the world.</p>
    <br>
    <p id="moreMe">Aside from my passion for computer science, I am also a huge fan of sports, particularly soccer and
      baseball. As a huge fan of the Mexican league (Liga MX), I am an avid supporter of Club America, Puebla, and
      Tigres. In Europe, one of my favorite teams is Bayern Munich. In baseball, I am a die-hard fan of the Yankees.
